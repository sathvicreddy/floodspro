        <h2>Floods</h2>
        <p>Floods are natural disasters that occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. They can be caused by various factors, including heavy rainfall, snowmelt, storm surges from hurricanes or typhoons, rapid ice melting, or the breaching of dams or levees.

            There are several types of floods:
            
            Riverine floods: These occur when rivers or streams overflow due to heavy rainfall or melting snow, causing the water to spill onto adjacent land.
            
            Flash floods: These are sudden and often unexpected floods that can occur within minutes or hours of intense rainfall or a dam/levee failure. They can be particularly dangerous due to their rapid onset and swift currents.
            
            Coastal floods: These occur in coastal areas due to storm surges caused by tropical cyclones, hurricanes, or tsunamis, leading to the inundation of coastal land.
            
            Urban floods: Heavy rainfall overwhelming drainage systems in urban areas can cause water to accumulate on streets and flood buildings.
            
            Floods can have devastating consequences, including loss of life, damage to infrastructure, destruction of crops, displacement of communities, and contamination of water sources. They can lead to long-term economic and environmental impacts, disrupting transportation, affecting agriculture, and causing erosion and sedimentation.
            
            Efforts to mitigate flood risks include the construction of dams, levees, and flood barriers, improved urban planning to enhance drainage systems, early warning systems, and educating communities about preparedness and evacuation procedures.
            
            Climate change is also a significant factor influencing floods. Rising global temperatures can lead to more frequent and intense precipitation events, altering weather patterns and potentially increasing the risk of flooding in many regions worldwide.
            
            Efforts to address the impacts of climate change and adapt to its effects, such as implementing better water management strategies and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are crucial in mitigating future flood risks.</p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>During a flood, safety measures are crucial to protect lives and minimize damage. Here are essential safety precautions to take during a flood:

            Stay informed: Keep abreast of weather updates and flood warnings through reliable sources like the National Weather Service or local news channels. Follow evacuation orders issued by authorities.</p>
            
            <p>Evacuate if necessary: If authorities advise or mandate evacuation, leave the area immediately. Follow designated evacuation routes and never attempt to drive through flooded areas, as the depth and current of the water can be deceptive and dangerous.</p>
            
            <p>Move to higher ground: If evacuation is not mandated but flooding is imminent, move to higher ground or upper floors of buildings. Avoid basements and ground-level areas.</p>
            
            <p>Avoid walking through floodwaters: Floodwaters can be contaminated and hide dangers such as debris, downed power lines, or open manholes. Additionally, swift currents can easily sweep a person away. If you must wade through water, use a stick to check for depth and stability.</p>
            
            <p>Turn off utilities: Shut off gas, electricity, and water mains to prevent accidents, electrical hazards, or gas leaks. However, only do this if it's safe to access the main switches or valves. Otherwise, seek professional help.</p>
            
            <p>Avoid contact with floodwater: It might be contaminated by sewage, chemicals, or other hazardous substances. Wash thoroughly if you come into contact with floodwater.</p>
            
            <p>Stay informed and connected: Keep a battery-powered radio, charged cell phone, or other communication devices handy to receive updates and emergency information.</p>
            
            <p>Assist others: Help elderly neighbors, individuals with disabilities, or those in need to evacuate if it's safe to do so without putting yourself at risk.</p>
            
            <p>Keep emergency supplies: Have a stocked emergency kit including non-perishable food, water, first aid supplies, flashlights, batteries, and essential medications.</p>
            
            <p>Be cautious after the flood: Even after waters recede, be cautious about returning home. Check for structural damage before entering your property. Be aware of potential hazards like weakened foundations, debris, or contaminated water.</p>
            
            <p>Seek assistance: If you require help or encounter emergency situations, call emergency services immediately.</p>
            
            <p>Remember, personal safety should be the top priority during a flood. Follow instructions from authorities and use common sense to stay out of harm's way.</p>

        <h2>What to do Before a Flood</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Be informed by receiving alerts, warnings, and public safety information before, during, and after emergencies</li>
            <li>Find out whether your property is in a flood-prone or high-risk area. Explore the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) flood maps.</li>
            <li>Contact your local Emergency Management Director to find out if your home or workplace is downstream from a dam and learn more about your community’s risk of flooding.</li>
            <li>Assemble an emergency kit.</li>
            <li>Make a record of your personal property by taking photos or videos of your belongings. Store these records in a safe place.</li>
            <li>Flood losses are not typically covered under renter and homeowner’s insurance policies. Consider purchasing flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Plan (NFIP). Flood insurance is available in most communities whether or not your building is in a flood-prone area, but there is a 30-day waiting period before it goes into effect.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="tx">
        <h2>What to do During a Flood Watch or Flash Flood Watch</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Listen to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio or to a local news station for the latest information.</li>
            <li>Follow instructions given by public safety officials.</li>
            <li>Be alert to changing weather conditions and be ready to move to higher ground.</li>
            <li>Consider postponing outdoor activities.</li>
            <li>Tie down or bring in outdoor objects (patio furniture, children's toys, trash cans, etc.) that could be swept away or damaged during flooding.</li>
            <li>Consider unplugging sensitive electronic equipment before flooding occurs. But, do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water.</li>
            <li>Elevate items stored in your basement to prevent damage. If you have a sump pump, check that it is working.</li>
            <li>Consider clearing street catch basins to prevent or reduce street flooding.</li>
            <li>Avoid camping or parking along streams, rivers, creeks, or other areas prone to flooding during heavy rainfall. These areas can flood rapidly and with little warning.</li>
        </ul>
